# Task1_ToDoList

I've been working on a terminal based To-Do List Application in C++ that offers a seamless experience for managing tasks efficiently. Here are some key features :

ðŸ”¹ Add a Task: Easily add new tasks with priority levels (High, Medium, Low) and a due date in Day/Month/Year and hour in AM/PM format.

ðŸ”¹ Complete a Task: Mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough and the status "Done".

ðŸ”¹ Show All Tasks: View all your tasks, neatly organized by priority and due date. High-priority tasks appear first, and tasks with the same priority are sorted by the closest due date.Tasks are color-coded based on their priority for easy identification.

ðŸ”¹ Inquire About a Task: Get detailed information about any task, including its priority and description.

ðŸ”¹ Exit the Program: Easily exit the application when you're done.

The app ensures that your tasks are always displayed in the most logical order, making it easier to prioritize and manage your workload.
